1. Sorting with Index Mapping
Another approach is to sort the array and compare it with the original array to see where swaps are needed.

Strategy Outline:

Step 1: Create a sorted copy of the array.
Step 2: Create a map that tracks the positions of elements in the original array.
Step 3: Iterate through the original array:
If the current element is not in the correct position (compared to the sorted array), swap it with the element that should be in that position, updating the position map accordingly.
Step 4: Count the number of swaps made.
This approach works in O(n log n) due to the sorting step but requires careful tracking of indices and positions to minimize swaps.

Pros:

Simple conceptually.
Easier to implement but may not be as efficient as cycle detection.



2. Cycle Detection Method (Greedy Approach)
This is one of the most efficient methods to solve the problem. The idea is based on the fact that the array can be broken down into cycles. By swapping the elements within a cycle, you can sort the cycle with a minimal number of swaps.

Strategy Outline:

Step 1: Create an array of tuples where each element stores both the value and its original index. Then, sort this array based on the value.
Step 2: Use a visited array to track whether each element has already been placed in the correct position.
Step 3: For each unvisited element, traverse its cycle:
Count the number of elements in the cycle.
The minimum number of swaps required to sort a cycle of k elements is k-1.
Step 4: Sum up the swaps required for all cycles.
This approach works in O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

Pros:

Efficient for large arrays (time complexity dominated by sorting step).
Avoids unnecessary swaps by handling elements in cycles.

3. Graph-Based Approach
You can think of the array as a graph where each element points to the position it needs to go. Each cycle in this graph corresponds to a set of positions that can be sorted with minimal swaps.

Strategy Outline:

Step 1: Treat the array as a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, with each element pointing to its destination.
Step 2: Traverse the array to identify cycles (similar to cycle detection in the first method).
Step 3: Each cycle of length k can be sorted in k-1 swaps.
Step 4: Sum up the number of swaps for each cycle.
This approach essentially mirrors the cycle detection method but framed in graph terminology.

Pros:

Conceptually interesting for those familiar with graph theory.
Works well in identifying the minimal number of swaps by treating the problem as a permutation cycle problem.

Code in this case looks exactly identical to the cycle detection method, the difference lies only in the conceptual framing


4. Heap-Based Approach (Less Efficient)
A heap (min-heap) could be used to extract the smallest element and place it in its correct position in each step. However, this approach may not be optimal.

Strategy Outline:

Step 1: Build a min-heap from the array.
Step 2: Continuously extract the minimum element and place it in the correct position.
Step 3: Continue until the array is sorted.
Step 4: Track and count the number of swaps.
This approach works in O(n log n) due to heap operations but requires more data structures and can be inefficient compared to the cycle detection method.

Pros:

A valid approach but less optimal in terms of simplicity and performance.
