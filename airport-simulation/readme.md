In the airport simulation, I'm wondering how we should consider the waiting times of those passengers that arrived within simulation time, but did not complete both checks. Should we be consideringÂ those wait times in the average or not? If yes, how could we include their wait times?

The simplified scenario that we analyzed for HW9 shows two general scenarios:
- service capacity >= passenger arrival rate, indicated by steady queue lengths
- passenger arrival > service rate, indicated by growing queue lengths

In this scenario, given a steady number of service workers & a steady rate of passenger arrivals, the rate of change of the queue lengths indicates presence or lack of system stability and might be an adequate analysis. However, if we were to extend the analysis to a real-world scenario where both rates (service capacity and demand) fluctuate over the day, we can choose whether or not to increase service capacity in response to growing queue lengths.

KPIs / visualizations:
- Plot queue lengths over the day / week to show times of peak & trough 
- KPI - flights missed / near missed - would require 



## Alternative mechanisms that could be used to stabilize the simulation:

1. Adaptive Resource Adjustment:
   Instead of always increasing or decreasing resources by one, you could implement an adaptive approach. The size of the adjustment could be proportional to how far the current wait time is from the target. This would allow for larger changes when far from the target and smaller, more precise adjustments when close.

2. Moving Average:
   Rather than basing decisions on a single simulation run, you could use a moving average of the last N simulation results. This would smooth out fluctuations and prevent overreacting to a single anomalous result.

3. Probabilistic Resource Changes:
   Instead of deterministically changing resources every iteration, you could introduce a probability of change. This probability could increase the further you are from the target wait time, allowing the system to sometimes "settle" even if not exactly at the target.

4. Hysteresis:
   Implement different thresholds for increasing and decreasing resources. For example, only increase resources if the wait time is more than 1 minute above target, but only decrease if it's more than 2 minutes below. This prevents oscillation around the target value.

5. Simulated Annealing Approach:
   Borrow concepts from the simulated annealing optimization technique. Start with large, random changes to the number of checkers, and gradually "cool down" to smaller, more precise adjustments over time.

6. Resource Pools:
   Instead of separate counters for ID checkers and personal checkers, use a total resource pool. Allow for dynamic allocation between the two types based on current queue lengths.

7. Periodic Resets:
   If the simulation gets stuck in a local optimum, periodically reset to a random configuration to explore other potential solutions.

8. Time-based Adjustments:
   Incorporate time-of-day effects into your model. Perhaps different staffing levels are needed at different times, which could help stabilize the overall system.

9. Queue Length Consideration:
   In addition to wait times, consider the lengths of the queues when making staffing decisions. This could provide earlier indicators of developing problems.

10. Gradual Change Limits:
    Implement a maximum change limit per iteration, gradually decreasing this limit over time. This would prevent large oscillations while still allowing the system to converge on a solution.

These mechanisms could be implemented individually or in combination to help stabilize your simulation and prevent the infinite loop issue you're experiencing. Each approach has its own trade-offs in terms of complexity, convergence speed, and stability, so the best choice would depend on the specific characteristics of your airport system and simulation goals.

## Additional features that could be added to the airport security checkpoint simulation:

1. Implement a real-time visualization of queue lengths using matplotlib, updating every simulated minute.

2. Create a heat map showing congestion levels at different times of day across the simulation period.

3. Generate a line graph comparing wait times for ID check vs. personal check throughout the day.

4. Develop a Gantt chart-style visualization showing the utilization of each security checkpoint over time.

5. Implement a dynamic bar chart showing the number of passengers in each stage of the security process (waiting, ID check, personal check, completed) updated in real-time.

6. Add different passenger types (e.g., frequent flyers, families, business travelers) with varying processing times and arrival patterns.

7. Implement a fast-track lane for priority passengers, and measure its impact on overall wait times.

8. Introduce random security threat events that temporarily increase processing times for all passengers.

9. Simulate staff breaks and shift changes, affecting the number of available checkers at different times.

10. Add a feature to handle multiple terminals, each with its own set of security checkpoints.

11. Implement a dynamic resource allocation system that moves staff between ID and personal checks based on current queue lengths.

12. Add a feature to simulate the impact of new security technologies (e.g., advanced scanners) on processing times.

13. Implement a passenger satisfaction score based on wait times and overall experience.

14. Create a module to simulate the impact of flight schedules on passenger arrival patterns.

15. Add a cost calculation feature to estimate staffing costs and optimize for both wait times and budget.

16. Implement a feature to simulate the impact of airport layout changes (e.g., adding or removing security lanes).

17. Create a machine learning module that predicts optimal staffing levels based on historical data and current conditions.

18. Develop a feature to simulate the impact of external factors like weather conditions or public transportation delays on passenger arrivals.

19. Implement a "what-if" scenario analyzer that allows users to compare different staffing strategies or process changes.

20. Add a feature to generate comprehensive reports including key performance indicators, graphs, and recommendations for improving efficiency.

21. Create an interactive dashboard where users can adjust simulation parameters in real-time and see the results immediately.

22. Implement a passenger flow animation using pygame or a similar library to visually represent movement through the security checkpoint.

23. Develop a network graph visualization showing the relationships between different parts of the security process and how changes in one area affect others.
